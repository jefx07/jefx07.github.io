<div class="blankslate">
  <p>This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will
  stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation.</p>
</div>

<p>Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site
visitors. As a new user, you should delete this page and create new pages for your
content. Have fun!</p>
